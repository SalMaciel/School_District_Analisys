# School District Analisys
## Overview of School District Analisys
The purpose of this analysis is to know and undertsand school's performance and budgetary spending for key metrics such as math, reading and both. We will compare how schools perform by type, by student size and we will determine school's spending per student.
## Results

- Thomas High School performs poorly compared to other schools, we have to remember that nine graders scores were ommited. This new result, lowers Thomas High School performance overall.
- For math and reading scores, there isn't much difference between the two results.
- For math and reading percentages we see a bigger dip in performance.
- For school size there it was a mix bag with some metrics been affected negatively.
- By school Type we see a small dip in performance except for % passing math for the district type of school which was affected significally more than the rest.
## Summary
After the ninth graders were removed for the analisys, the 3 key metrics most affected were reading pass percentage, math pass percentage and overall passing percentage. This changes can be seen in all summaries: district summary, schools summaries, school type and school size summaries. It make sense to expect percentages to go down, after all school size remains the same but by replacing the nine grader's grades with NaN's, mathematicaly speaking, this is as if they scored 0.
